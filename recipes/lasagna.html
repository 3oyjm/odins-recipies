    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Lasagna is a classic Italian dish made of stacked layers
            of wide flat pasta sheets alternated with delicious fillings
            such as Bolognese sauce, creamy béchamel sauce, and cheese,
            typically mozzarella and Parmesan. It's then baked until
            the layers meld together, creating a hearty, comforting 
            meal that's beloved worldwide.

            </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Preheat the oven: </strong> Preheat your oven
                 to 375°F (190°C).</li>

            <li><strong>Prepare the Noodles: </strong>If you're using
                traditional lasagna noodles that require boiling,
                cook them according to the package instructions
                until they're al dente. If using no-boil noodles,
                skip this step.</li>

            <li><strong>Prepare the Meat Sauce: </strong>
                In a large skillet or saucepan, heat olive oil
                over medium heat. Add diced onions and minced garlic,
                sauté until translucent. Add ground beef or Italian sausage,
                cook until browned. Drain excess fat if necessary.
                Stir in tomato sauce or crushed tomatoes, 
                Italian seasoning, salt, and pepper. Simmer
                the sauce for about 10-15 minutes, allowing 
                the flavors to meld.</li>

            <li><strong>Prepare the Ricotta Mixture: </strong>
                In a mixing bowl, combine ricotta cheese,
                an egg, grated Parmesan cheese, salt, and pepper.
                Mix until well combined.</li>

            <li><strong>Assemble the Lasagna: </strong>
                In a baking dish, spread a thin layer of meat sauce
                on the bottom. Layer lasagna noodles over the sauce, 
                slightly overlapping them. Spread a layer of the ricotta
                mixture over the noodles, followed by a layer of shredded
                mozzarella cheese. Repeat the layers until you reach the 
                top of the baking dish, finishing with a layer of meat 
                sauce and a generous sprinkle of mozzarella and Parmesan 
                cheese on</li>

            <li><strong>Bake the Lasagna: </strong>
                Cover the baking dish with aluminum foil and
                bake in the preheated oven for about 25-30 minutes.
                Then, remove the foil and continue baking for an
                additional 10-15 minutes, or until the cheese is
                melted and bubbly, and the edges are golden
                brown.</li>

            <li><strong>Let it Rest: </strong>
                Remove the lasagna from the oven and
                let it rest for about 10 minutes before 
                slicing and serving. This allows the lasagna 
                to set and makes it easier to slice into neat 
                portions.</li>

            <li><strong>Serve and Enjoy: </strong>
                Serve the lasagna warm, garnished with fresh 
                basil or parsley if desired. Enjoy your delicious 
                homemade lasagna!</li>
