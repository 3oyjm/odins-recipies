    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Indulge in the timeless delight of homemade chocolate 
        chip cookies. With a perfectly golden-brown exterior and 
        a soft, chewy center, each bite is a symphony of rich, 
        buttery dough interlaced with pockets of gooey, melted 
        chocolate. Whether enjoyed warm from the oven or savored 
        with a glass of cold milk, these cookies are a comforting 
        treat that never fails to satisfy</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, at room temperature</li>
            <li>3/4 cup granulated sugar</li>
            <li>3/4 cup packed light brown sugar</li>
            <li>2 large eggs</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>2 cups semisweet chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Preheat your oven for perfect cookies: </strong>
                Set the oven to 375°F (190°C) and prepare your baking sheets with parchment paper or silicone mats.</li>

            <li><strong>Cream your way to cookie perfection: </strong>
                In a large mixing bowl, blend together the room temperature butter, granulated sugar, and light brown sugar until luxuriously smooth.</li>

            <li><strong>Egg-cellent addition: </strong>
                Beat in the eggs, one at a time, ensuring each is fully incorporated, and then infuse the mixture with aromatic vanilla extract.</li>

            <li><strong>Blend with precision:</strong>
                In a separate bowl, whisk together the all-purpose flour, baking soda, and salt, ensuring a uniform blend of dry ingredients.</li>

            <li><strong>Marriage of wet and dry: </strong>
                Gradually introduce the dry ingredients into the wet mixture, stirring until just combined, avoiding overmixing for tender cookies.</li>

            <li><strong>Chocolatey embrace: </strong>
                Gently fold in the semisweet chocolate chips, ensuring they're evenly distributed throughout the dough, creating pockets of melted indulgence.</li>

            <li><strong>Portion with care: </strong>
                Using a cookie scoop or spoon, dollop rounded tablespoons of dough onto the prepared baking sheets, allowing ample space for spreading.</li>

            <li><strong>Golden transformation: </strong>
                Bake in the preheated oven for 8 to 10 minutes until the edges turn lightly golden brown, heralding the perfect bake.</li>

            <li><strong>Brief resting period: </strong>
                Let the cookies cool on the baking sheets for a few minutes to set before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</li>
            
            <li><strong>Savor the sweetness: </strong>
                Enjoy your homemade chocolate chip cookies warm or at room temperature, and store any leftovers in an airtight container for continued 
                blissful enjoyment.</li>
        </ol>
