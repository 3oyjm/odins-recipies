            <li>Cocoa powder or finely chopped chocolate</li>
            <li>Sweetener (granulated sugar, honey, maple syrup, or any sweetener you prefer)</li>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Prepare for warmth: </strong>
                Begin by gathering your ingredients and selecting your favorite mug to hold the rich, velvety cocoa goodness.</li>

            <li><strong>Prime your pot: </strong>
                In a small saucepan, pour in your desired amount of milk, choosing whole milk for extra creaminess or opting for a dairy-free alternative 
                for a vegan-friendly option.</li>

            <li><strong>Savor the sweetness: </strong>
                Add your preferred sweetener to the milk, whether it's granulated sugar, honey, or maple syrup, adjusting to taste 
                for the perfect level of sweetness.</li>

            <li><strong>Embrace the essence: </strong>
                For an extra layer of flavor, sprinkle in a pinch of ground cinnamon, a dash of vanilla extract, or a hint of peppermint 
                extract, elevating your hot chocolate to new heights of deliciousness.</li>

            <li><strong>Whisk with finesse: </strong>
                Over medium heat, whisk the milk mixture gently until it begins to steam and small bubbles form around the edges, 
                infusing the liquid with warmth and flavor.</li>

            <li><strong>Chocolate infusion: </strong>
                Add high-quality cocoa powder or finely chopped chocolate to the pot, stirring continuously until it melts into 
                the milk, creating a luscious, chocolatey elixir.</li>

            <li><strong>Texture perfection: </strong>
                For added richness and indulgence, whisk in a small amount of heavy cream or a dollop of whipped cream until fully 
                incorporated, imparting a silky smoothness to your hot chocolate.</li>

            <li><strong>Customize to your liking: </strong>
                Taste the hot chocolate and adjust the sweetness or flavorings as needed, ensuring it's tailored to your personal preferences.</li>

            <li><strong>Ladle with care: </strong>
                Pour the hot chocolate into your waiting mug, taking in the aroma of warm cocoa as it fills the air, ready 
                to envelop you in its comforting embrace.</li>

            <li><strong>Garnish and enjoy: </strong>
                Top your hot chocolate with a swirl of whipped cream, a sprinkle of cocoa powder, or a few mini marshmallows 
                for an extra touch of decadence, then cozy up with your mug and savor each soothing sip.</li>
        </ol>
